        <p>I am a Doctoral Candidate in
          <a class="link" href="https://laup.arch.tamu.edu/academics/graduate/ursc/overview/index.html">Urban and Regional Sciences</a>
          at <a class="link" href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>.
          My research broadly focuses on housing affordability; specifically,
          developing new models to measure owner- or renter-occupied housing affordability.
          I am also building a framework &mdash; the first of its kind &mdash; to model owner-occupied housing
          affordability and neighborhood opportunity concurrently.</p>
        <p>I currently work alongside Research Economists at the
          Texas Real Estate Research Center to estimate housing needs for communities across Texas.
          I received my masters degree in Land Economics and Real Estate from Texas A&M University
          in 2017 and my undergraduate degrees in Geography and Urban Studies, with honors,
          from the University of Texas at Austin in 2016.</p>
