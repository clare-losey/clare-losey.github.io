        <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the
          <a class="link" href="https://www.me.vt.edu/">Mechanical Engineering Department</a>
          at <a class="link" href="https://vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>.
        My research interests lie at the intersection of human-robot interaction, machine learning, and control theory:
        I develop learning and control algorithms to personalize robots that collaborate with people.</p>
        <p>I was previously a postdoctoral scholar in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University.
        I received my doctoral degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rice University in 2018,
        and my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Vanderbilt University in 2014.
        In 2017, I was also a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
